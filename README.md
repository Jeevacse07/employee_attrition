Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

# Employee Attrition and Performance Prediction

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict two key HR metrics:
1. Whether an employee is likely to **leave the company** (Attrition Prediction).
2. The **performance rating** of an employee (Performance Prediction).

Both models are deployed using a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows interactive predictions.

## üß† Models

- **XGBoost Classifier** was used for both predictions due to its performance on structured data.
- Models were trained after performing **feature engineering and selection**, and saved using `joblib`.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit joblib numpy
    ```

2. Make sure the following files are in the same directory:
    - `employee_attrition_performance_prediction_app.py`
    - `attrition_xgboost_model.pkl`
    - `performance_rating_xgboost_model.pkl`

3. Run the app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run employee_attrition_performance_prediction_app.py
    ```

4. Use the **two tabs**:
    - **Attrition** tab for predicting employee attrition.
    - **Performance** tab for predicting performance rating.

## ‚úÖ Output

- For Attrition Prediction:
  - "Employee Will leave" or "Employee Will not leave"
  
- For Performance Rating:
  - "Employee Good Rating" or "Employee Average Rating"

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- Add feature scaling and categorical encoding steps dynamically based on new data.
- Enable batch prediction with CSV upload.
- Improve UI for easier usage with dropdowns/radio buttons for categorical features.
- Integrate model explanation using SHAP or LIME.
